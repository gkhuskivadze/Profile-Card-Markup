- Instead of pixel unit I used rem, gave fixed number of 10px but with percent to html element to not lose option for font size manipulation.
- There is one main container whose height is set to match full viewport using VH CSS unit.
- To center various elements I used CSS Flexbox.
- To add two pictures on the on the background I used Background CSS property and positioned it.
- For Avatar positioning here I used absolute and relative values of Position CSS property.
- In this markup I started to use combined selectors to increase time and use space efficiently.
- I used Media Queries for the first time.
